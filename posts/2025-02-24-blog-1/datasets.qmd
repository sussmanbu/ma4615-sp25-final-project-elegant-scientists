## MA Air Quality: EPA Dataset
[Download HERE!](https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data/download-daily-data) 
This data set shows daily measures of various air pollutants across the United States. We hope to focus on neighborhoods around Boston, filtering data before downloading as follows:

* Pollutant: PM2.5
* Year: 2020
* Location: MA - Suffolk County

This will provide us with data from three sites: Kenmore Sq., Roxbury, and Dorchester. We would then compare particulate matter (PM) across 2020 census data to explore potential trends in pollutant exposure by race near Boston.
